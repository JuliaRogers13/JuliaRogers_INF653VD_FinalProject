# Julia Rogers â€“ INF653 Final Project

## Project Overview  
This project is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It serves U.S. state data from a provided static statesData.json file and allows users to perform CRUD operations on additional "fun facts" stored in a MongoDB Atlas collection.

The backend uses:
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB Atlas
- Mongoose for the schema/model
- dotenv for secure environment configuration

## API Structure  
All responses are in JSON format unless otherwise specified. The base URL is:  
https://juliarogers-inf653vd-finalproject.onrender.com
